%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate pattern general [shape:(2,5,5,4,1);order:(0,3,1,2,4)]
% MatrixMarket with PieRank extensions:
% E1: It is a 5D tensor with shape (2, 5, 5, 4, 1)
% E2: The storage order is (0, 3, 1, 2, 4), which is primarily by 1st dim (0),
%     then secondarily by 4th dim (3), then tertiary by 2nd dim (1),
%     then quaternary by 3rd dim (2), and lastly by 5th dim (4).
% Assumptions:
% A1: The last dimension is depth, which is ALWAYS dense.
% A2: The last dimension is ALWAYS the last in the storage order
% A3: The #rows & #cols are determined by the first two dimensions in the
%     storage order, such that if order[0] < order[1], then:
%         #rows = shape[order[0]] and #cols = shape[order[1]]
%     otherwise,
%         #rows = shape[order[1]] and #cols = shape[order[0]]
% For example, the original (unextended) Matrix Market format maps to these
% extensions: [shape:(#rows,#cols,1),order:(1,0,2)], as original .mtx file
% has column-major ordering.
