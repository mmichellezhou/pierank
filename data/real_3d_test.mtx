%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real general [shape:(5,5,2);order:(0,1,2)]
% MatrixMarket with PieRank extensions:
% E1: It is a 3D tensor with shape (5, 5, 2)
% E2: The storage order is (0, 1, 2), same as a multi-dimensional C array
% Assumptions:
% A1: The last dimension is depth, which is ALWAYS dense.
% A2: The last dimension is ALWAYS the last in the storage order
% A3: The #rows & #cols are determined by the first two dimensions in the
%     storage order, such that if order[0] < order[1], then:
%         #rows = shape[order[0]] and #cols = shape[order[1]]
%     otherwise,
%         #rows = shape[order[1]] and #cols = shape[order[0]]
% For example, the original Matrix Market format maps to these extensions:
% [shape:(#rows,#cols,1),order:(1,0,2)], as .mtx file has column-major ordering.
